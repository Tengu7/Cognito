### 2024-09-30 - 2hr: Animation part 3
* Item 1 - The animation is like 75% working. I have no idea how to fix it.

### 2024-09-29 - 3hr: Animation part 2
* Item 1 - Managed to get a draw card animation
* Item 2 - Tried to get a card flip animation. It sort of works, but it's buggy as hell. Send help
* Item 3 - Fucked up, deleted all the animations and now the card images won't show up. Why.

### 2024-09-27 - 4hr: ChatGPT to the rescue
* Item 1 - Used ChatGPT to help make a card class, deck manager class
* Item 2 - Got everything to work, actually. Now all I have to do is make it prettier, add all the cards, and add the endings.
* Item 3 - Fixed a bug where the deck wouldn't remove cards even after being drawn. This took SO. LONG.
* Item 4 - Created a feature where the original story text would disappear in the face of the CYOA text. As It turns out, ChatGPT was superemely unhelpful here, I figured it out on my own after an hour of struggle.
* Item 5 - Added final question and endings
